debian-scripts


Several Scripts I use in my daily life, since I'm never sure if my computer
was hacked or it's just that there are some sort of hardware backdoors like
AX.25 since IBM gave the "unprofitable" Operating System Marked to Microsoft

go, doggy world population, search the backdoor stick at Microsoft, but not
at IBM nor at the CIA and go, doggy world population, search another stick
at the NSA (Security through obscurity of the COMINT Platform?) but not
at the CIA.

Mind Control was CIA's main "research" topic since ~1950
y=[DSM]  |   z=[CIA MKULTRA (HUMINT)]  ||  dy/dt <=> dz/dt

in our opinion NSA is just the communication platform, telling the people about
the existence gives the CIA at least 3 benefits
"Game-Strategy": maximum yield algorithm, completely ignoring human lifes.

1. the "silence of the lambs" continues, people fear to use the internet or social media
2. 1->2: so they don't talk about these topics, secrecy is an euphemism for covering-up the things they've done
3. the communication platform will be attacked, so satans communication develops faster
->even if Snowden seems to be true with the world

#US4877027  |  #WO2005055579A1  |  #US6169924B1 (1960s,today most likely "upgraded" to all the "wires" in the spinal cord)

in addition the western TV always gives a scapegoat
jews, russians, tor users, linux usersm muslims, even 5 Years old innocent muslim grils
but more worse, the people beleive the mass media...
